# Gomoku
The aim of this project was to create a gomoku game and then create an AI able to compete with a human player.
I used Unity to create the visuals and gameplay elements. The Ai is developed in C++ using recursive functions.  
It goes to a depth of 2, which means it calculates the best play 2 turns in advance.
The result is a defensive AI pretty hard to beat.
